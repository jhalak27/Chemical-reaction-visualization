# Chemical Reaction Visualization

The simulation of the reaction will include a ​ 3-D view​ of the compound structure with each kind of atom having a unique size, color​, and texture over it. Tapping on the atom will give information about it in a ​ text field. The
text also includes instruction keys present for user help and information about the reaction current reaction.
The reaction simulation includes the breaking of old bonds, the movement of concerned atoms from one compound to another, and the formation of new bonds that includes 3-D transformations, Animation, and Moving Objects.

For interaction, we can use different keys and change the view using the mouse (Mouse and​ Keyboard Input​).

## Steps to run

1. Clone the repository

2. Run command
   `g++ main.cpp -o main -lglut -lGLU -lGL -g`

or you could simply run `./main` file
